    ... solves the self-consistent field for the extended-optimal-level (EOL) functional: orbitals are
        optimized against a statistically-(2J+1)-weighted combination of one or more target ASF levels,
        with the combination weights coming from the levels' own CI mixing coefficients -- never a
        user-supplied weight. The target level(s) are selected EXCLUSIVELY via settings.levelSelectionCI
        (either indices or symmetries, never both; if inactive/empty, defaults to indices=[1], a genuine
        OL/single-level computation). This nests a CI diagonalization inside the AL/Claude2 SCF loop
        (GRASP rmcdhf90's scf.f90, algorithm 5.1 of Froese Fischer, Comput. Phys. Rep. 3 (1986) 290):
        diagonalize -> build generalized coefficients from the target levels' mixing vectors -> refine
        every orbital (reusing computeFockMatrixClaude2/computeTwoElectronVClaude2 unchanged) ->
        re-diagonalize -> repeat, converging on both orbital self-consistency and the weighted-average
        energy. Per-CSF-pair angular coefficients (cacheCsfPairCoefficientsEOL) are computed once and
        reused every outer iteration, since they depend only on the fixed CSF list, never on the current
        orbitals or mixing coefficients. A (new) multiplet::Multiplet is returned.

        KNOWN LIMITATION (confirmed 28-Jul-2026, NOT yet fixed): when two or more CSFs of the SAME symmetry
        block compete for the same correlation channel (e.g. Be's 1s^2 2p_1/2^2 vs 1s^2 2p_3/2^2, both
        correlating with 1s^2 2s^2), this implementation can converge to a spurious, winner-take-all fixed
        point where one competing CSF's mixing coefficient is driven to ~0 while a comparably-important
        partner is not -- confirmed against a DFS-Field reference occupying the same CSF space, which lands
        both more bound AND with both CSFs contributing substantially. Root cause: the off-diagonal
        (CSF-pair) coefficients folded into computeTwoElectronVClaude2's two-electron potential scale
        LINEARLY in a shrinking CSF's own mixing coefficient, while computeGeneralizedOccupationEOL's
        occupation (the (1.0/occ) divisor in computeFockMatrixClaude2) scales QUADRATICALLY in it -- so the
        ratio diverges as that coefficient shrinks, rather than settling. This is the concrete manifestation
        of the "DA/inhomogeneous-term mechanism" gap vs. GRASP's setcof.f90 (which treats within-level
        off-diagonal coupling as a separate inhomogeneous/source term, not folded into the same per-orbital
        homogeneous eigenvalue division) -- see project_eol_implementation.md. Flooring `occ` before the
        division was tried and REJECTED as a fix (non-monotonic in the floor constant). Safe for
        single-CSF-per-block cases (validated: He, Li) and multi-CSF cases where every competing CSF's own
        weight stays comfortably bounded away from zero; NOT yet safe/reliable for genuine near-degenerate
        competing correlation (Be's 2p^2 case, and by extension most 3+ layer RAS scenarios). A real fix
        needs the actual inhomogeneous-term mechanism -- deferred, substantial future work.
